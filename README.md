## Introduction

**Do people generally prefer high calorie foods or low calorie ones?**  

To answer this question, appropriate dataset and rigorous hypothesis test are necessary. In this project, research will be conducted on the dataset **Recipes and Ratings**. This dataset contains two tables, one for recipes and one for reviews/ratings. For the purpose of this project, the two tables will be merged and used as one dataset of 234429 rows.  
Some key attributes of the dataset include:  

* recipe_id: Recipe ID
* user_id: User ID
* minutes: Minutes to prepare recipe
* calories: Calories of the recipe
* avg_rating: The average rating of the recipe
